# Nav-Quad-Husky
 Study and Development of Algorithms for the Cooperative Motion of a Multi-Copter Rotorcraft- Robot Vehicle Tractor Using Optical Feedback

<H1>Introduction</H1>
This Github repo features a UAV simulator integrating ArduCopter and MAVROS communication. It is developed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using ROS Melodic (https://wiki.ros.org/melodic) and Gazebo 9.

Before continuing with the packages explanation you should have install the ArduPilot/Copter SITL on Linux based on the thread below. Setting up SITL on Linux: https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/setting-up-sitl-on-linux.html

<H1>Packages explanation</H1>
<H2>Ardupilot_gazebo</H2>
The following plugin is a pure Gazebo plugin, so ROS is not needed to use it. You can still use ROS with Gazebo with normal gazebo-ros packages. It is based on the ArduPilot documentation (https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/using-gazebo-simulator-with-sitl.html). The current package is a combination of the basic ardupilot_gazebo packages:
https://github.com/khancyr/ardupilot_gazebo
https://github.com/SwiftGust/ardupilot_gazebo
with some new and modified models according to the simulator's use. Recommendation to study the Using Gazebo Simulator with SITL tutorial and then installing the present ardupilot_gazebo package in this repository.

<H2>Mavros</H2>
MAVLink extendable communication node for ROS. Modification made based on the original package (https://github.com/mavlink/mavros) in order to adapt it to our needs.

<H2>Usb_cam</H2>
A ROS driver for V4L USB cameras. In the simulator's case it can be used to extract image information from the ZED stereo camera mounted on our iris quadcopter. Source code: https://github.com/ros-drivers/usb_cam (modifications were made).

<H2>Iris_coastline</H2>
Package launching the modified vrx world with an iris quadcopter featuring a ZED stereo camera, ArduCopter and MAVROS communications.

<H2>Iris_gazebo and Iris_navigation</H2>
Packages created for a 2D navigation demo of the quadcopter featuring obstacle avoidance while using the move_base (https://wiki.ros.org/move_base) ROS package and Hokuyo Lidar.

<h1>Install</h1>
Create a catkin workspace with the following commands:

```
$ cd ~
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
After the the workspace is ready, clone the repository:
```
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/sotomotocross/UAV_simulator_ArduCopter.git
$ git clone https://github.com/HBPNeurorobotics/gazebo_dvs_plugin.git
$ git clone https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_dvs_ros.git
$ git clone https://github.com/catkin/catkin_simple.git
```
Build the ardupilot_gazebo package (cross-check with the Using Gazebo Simulator with SITL documentation given above):

```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/ardupilot_gazebo
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install
```

Set path of Gazebo Models/Worlds... Open up .bashrc

```
$ sudo gedit ~/.bashrc
```
Copy & Paste Following at the end of .bashrc file

```
$ source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh
```
```
$ export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=~/catkin_ws/src/UAV_simulator_ArduCopter/ardupilot_gazebo/models:${GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH}
$ export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=~/catkin_ws/src/UAV_simulator_ArduCopter/ardupilot_gazebo/models_gazebo:${GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH}
$ export GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=~/catkin_ws/src/UAV_simulator_ArduCopter/ardupilot_gazebo/worlds:${GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH}
$ export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=~/catkin_ws/src/UAV_simulator_ArduCopter/ardupilot_gazebo/build:${GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH}
```

Go to the rpg_dvs_ros github repo (https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_dvs_ros) and install all the dependencies according to the documentation of the package. Since the catkin_make of the ecatkin_ws is succesful you can build the simulator:

```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/UAV_simulator_ArduCopter/mavros/mavros/scripts
$ ./install_geographiclib_datasets.sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
```
Install is complete

Now launch a world file with a copter/rover/plane and ardupilot plugin, and it should work!

<h1>Demanding script changes</h1>

<h2>First</h2>
File: iris_coastline.launch Inside the iris_coastline package. In the line 86 you change the path of the model.sdf launched inside the script
arg name="sdf_robot_file" default="/home/$USER$/catkin_ws/src/UAV_simulator_ArduCopter/ardupilot_gazebo/models/iris_with_ardupilot_and_zed_stereocamera/model.sdf"
 
<h2>Second</h2>
File spawn_drone.launch Inside the iris_gazebo package. In the line 13 change the path for the model.sdf file launched inside the script.
arg name="sdf_robot_file" default="/home/$USER$/catkin_ws/src/UAV_simulator_ArduCopter/ardupilot_gazebo/models/iris_with_lidar/model.sdf"
