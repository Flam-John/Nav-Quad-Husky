# Nav-Quad-Husky
 Study and Development of Algorithms for the Cooperative Motion of a Multi-Copter Rotorcraft- Robot Vehicle Tractor Using Optical Feedback

<H1>Introduction</H1>
This Github repo features a UAV simulator integrating ArduCopter and MAVROS communication. It is developed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using ROS Melodic (https://wiki.ros.org/melodic) and Gazebo 9.

Before continuing with the packages explanation you should have install the ArduPilot/Copter SITL on Linux based on the thread below. Setting up SITL on Linux: https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/setting-up-sitl-on-linux.html

<H1>Packages explanation</H1>
<H2>Ardupilot_gazebo</H2>
The following plugin is a pure Gazebo plugin, so ROS is not needed to use it. You can still use ROS with Gazebo with normal gazebo-ros packages. It is based on the ArduPilot documentation (https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/using-gazebo-simulator-with-sitl.html). The current package is a combination of the basic ardupilot_gazebo packages:
https://github.com/khancyr/ardupilot_gazebo
https://github.com/SwiftGust/ardupilot_gazebo
with some new and modified models according to the simulator's use. Recommendation to study the Using Gazebo Simulator with SITL tutorial and then installing the present ardupilot_gazebo package in this repository.

<H2>Mavros</H2>
MAVLink extendable communication node for ROS. Modification made based on the original package (https://github.com/mavlink/mavros) in order to adapt it to our needs.

<H2>Iris_coastline</H2>
Package launching the modified vrx world with an iris quadcopter featuring a ZED stereo camera, ArduCopter and MAVROS communications.

<H2>Iris_gazebo and Iris_navigation</H2>
Packages created for a 2D navigation demo of the quadcopter featuring obstacle avoidance while using the move_base (https://wiki.ros.org/move_base) ROS package and Hokuyo Lidar.

<h1>Install</h1>
Create a catkin workspace with the following commands:

```
$ cd ~
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
After the the workspace is ready, clone the repository:
```

```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/$USER$/UAV_simulator_ArduCopter.git
$ git clone https://github.com/HBPNeurorobotics/gazebo_dvs_plugin.git
$ git clone https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_dvs_ros.git
$ git clone https://github.com/catkin/catkin_simple.git
```
Build the ardupilot_gazebo package (cross-check with the Using Gazebo Simulator with SITL documentation given above):

```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/ardupilot_gazebo
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install
```

Set path of Gazebo Models/Worlds... Open up .bashrc

```
$ sudo gedit ~/.bashrc
```
Copy & Paste Following at the end of .bashrc file

```
$ source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh
```
```
$ export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=~/catkin_ws/src/UAV_simulator_ArduCopter/ardupilot_gazebo/models:${GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH}
$ export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=~/catkin_ws/src/UAV_simulator_ArduCopter/ardupilot_gazebo/models_gazebo:${GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH}
$ export GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=~/catkin_ws/src/UAV_simulator_ArduCopter/ardupilot_gazebo/worlds:${GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH}
$ export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=~/catkin_ws/src/UAV_simulator_ArduCopter/ardupilot_gazebo/build:${GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH}
```

Go to the rpg_dvs_ros github repo (https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_dvs_ros) and install all the dependencies according to the documentation of the package. Since the catkin_make of the ecatkin_ws is succesful you can build the simulator:

```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/UAV_simulator_ArduCopter/mavros/mavros/scripts
$ ./install_geographiclib_datasets.sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
```
Install is complete

Now launch a world file with a copter/rover/plane and ardupilot plugin, and it should work!

<h1>Demanding script changes</h1>

<h2>First</h2>
File: iris_coastline.launch Inside the iris_coastline package. In the line 86 you change the path of the model.sdf launched inside the script

```
<arg name="sdf_robot_file" default="/home/$USER$/catkin_ws/src/UAV_simulator_ArduCopter/ardupilot_gazebo/models/iris_with_ardupilot_and_zed_stereocamera/model.sdf"/>
```

<h2>Second</h2>
File spawn_drone.launch Inside the iris_gazebo package. In the line 13 change the path for the model.sdf file launched inside the script.

```
<arg name="sdf_robot_file" default="/home/$USER$/catkin_ws/src/UAV_simulator_ArduCopter/ardupilot_gazebo/models/iris_with_lidar/model.sdf"/>
```
<h1>Usage</h1>

1rst terminal (Start the world with robots):

1) Move to the folder where the world iris_coastline.launch is located ``` cd ~/simulator_ws  ```

2) Declare the address in the terminal with the source prefix ``` source devel/setup.bash  ```
   
3) Start the iris_coastline.launch startup which is in the package iris_coastline package with the roslaunch option ``` roslaunch iris_coastline iris_coastline.launch ```

2nd terminal (Start SITL) :

1) move to the folder where the start of the autopilot of the quadrotor. ``` cd ~/ardupilot/ArduCopter/ ```

2) gazebo-iris : the quadrotor's model, ArduCopter: in the folder where quadrotor is in, --mavproxy-args="--streamrate=30: messages that sent at a frequency of 30 hz, sim_vehicle.py: The python program that the autopilot runs. ``` sim_vehicle.py --mavproxy-args="--streamrate=30" -console --map -v ArduCopter -f gazebo-iris ```

3rd terminal (Start MAVROS):

1) move to the folder where the mavros root is located ``` cd ~/csl_uav_simulator_ws ```

2) declare the address in the terminal with the source prefix ```source devel/setup.bash ```

3) Start the apm.launch startup found in the mavros package with roslaunch command ```roslaunch mavros apm.launch```

2nd terminal (control mavlink to raise the quadrotor).

1) ```mode GUIDED```
mode Guided: This is used for applications where precise control is required.
control of the flight, such as in drones (used for
exploration, surveillance, aerial photography, videography, video surveillance, and surveillance missions
and others).

First we wait for the GPS to be activated and then we wait for the
that we can arm it.

2) ```Arm throttle```
Arm throttle: Activates the drone's motors and allows the drone to
drone to take off. When the "arm throttle" command is executed, the drone
the drone enters wake-up mode and is ready to take off as soon as the
the user gives the take-off command.

3) ```Takeoff (3-4)```
Takeoff: This command takes off the quadrotor at an altitude equal to the number
to be entered in the parameter.

4th terminal (Start Detection Aruco Marker):
1) Calls the aruco_detect.launch primitive found in the package aruco_detect package with the roslaunch prefix ```roslaunch aruco_detect aruco_detect.launch```


5th terminal (Observation of Aruco Marker from the Rviz):
1) Calls the fiducial_rviz.launch header found in the package fiducial_slam with the roslaunch option and opens rviz ```roslaunch fiducial_slam fiducial_rviz.launch```

6th terminal (Autopilot Visual control node):
1) Move to the directory that we need ```cd simulator_ws/src/simulator/scripts ```
2) The program in which the controller runs ```./visual_servoing.py```

A) 7th terminal (TELEOP movement of the husky):

1) Move to the directory we need ```cd simulator_ws/src/Husky/husky_control/scripts```
2) Manipulate husky with the keyboard ```./teleop_keyboard.py```

B) 7th terminal (motion controller of the husky):

This code is a program for controlling the robot to move to some specific coordinates. It uses ROS to communicate with Husky and receive the robot's odometry data. The code installs a ROS node and sets up a listener for the odometry data coming from the "/odometry/filtered" topic. Each time an odometry message is received, the callback function is called. In the callback function, the heading data (x, y, yaw) are retrieved from the odometry message. The robot's distance from a target (fixed values in the code) and the angle of motion to reach the next target are then calculated. The calculated linear and angular velocity values (u and w) are used to assign velocities to Husky via the "/cmd_vel" topic. This allows Husky to move towards the target. The process is repeated until the robot reaches the final target, at which point the program will terminate.

1) Move to the directory that we need ```cd simulator_ws/src/simulator/scripts```
2) The program in which the motion controller runs controller ```./husky_motion_controller.py ```


These terminals launch the sandislad world with the iris quadcopter, the Husky with the Aruco Marker, the SITL (both communication, telemetry, console and map) and the mavros communcations. If everyhting are launched succesfuly then you will have topics both from the ZED stereo camera.
